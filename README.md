# Honeyhive-monitoring-system- it will monitor the honey hive box and we will analyse the hive bix using beencount,sound, hive weight, temperature and humidity (inside the hive box)
in this project we used hivebox, temperature and humidity sensor, QRE1117 reflective sensor (for counting purpose),HX711 amplifier for load cell( weight), Microphone sensor (for sound),ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino cloud for output
